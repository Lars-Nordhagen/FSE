For each new page, create a new {NAME}.js file in the src/pages folder

In the page file make sure the first line is a single "{" and the last line is a single "}"
    This is to make sure variable names from different files do not interfere with each other

Instead of using a setup method for each page, just put the "setup" code that you want to run once at the top of the file

Still use the draw function and other custom functions as normal


Other code files that don't represent a page go directly under the src folder


To switch from one page to another page, use the line 'changePage("{NEW PAGE NAME}");'
    Do not include the ".js" in the name


To save information that will be permanant, even after changing pages, use the line: To be implemented
